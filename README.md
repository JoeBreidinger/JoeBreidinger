## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm continually developing my skills as a software engineer, with a passion for **software engineering**, **AI development**, and **cybersecurity**. My journey began in **culinary arts**, then **finance**, and **logistics** giving me a unique appreciation for both creative design and practical systems. I thrive at the intersection of front-end aesthetics and back-end logic, aiming to build solutions that are as beautiful as they are functional.

I developed a strong technical foundation to full-stack development at the **U of M Fullstack Academy Bootcamp**, where I expanded my technical toolkit and sharpening my problem-solving skills.

## 🌟 Bio

I bring a strong foundation in leadership, client engagement, and operational strategy, developed through first-hand experience in management, sales, logistics, and fast-paced service environments. These roles sharpened my ability to communicate clearly, solve problems under pressure, and lead cross-functional teams—skills that translate seamlessly into the collaborative, fast-evolving world of tech.

Growing up during the rise of digital innovation, I’ve been inspired to pursue a career in programming and automation, driven by a passion for continuous learning and building solutions that are both creative and practical. I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to a team that values quality and growth.

I am currently pursuing my CompTIA Security+ certification, an experience that has been both challenging and rewarding. Exploring the field of cybersecurity has broadened my perspective and deepened my curiosity—the more I learn, the more motivated I become to expand my knowledge. As I continue building a career in technology, I am committed to developing the skills necessary to safeguard critical data and contribute to secure, resilient systems.
